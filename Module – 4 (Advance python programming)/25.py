# What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology?

"""
Instantiation in object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to the process of creating an instance or an occurrence of a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects. When you instantiate a class, you create a specific object based on that class, with its own unique identity in memory.

In simpler terms, think of a class as a blueprint or a template, describing the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that type will have. When you instantiate that class, you create a concrete object that follows the structure defined by the class.

For instance, if you have a class named Car with attributes like color, make, and model, along with methods like start_engine and drive, when you instantiate the Car class, you create an actual car object with specific characteristics (e.g., a red Toyota Corolla). This object has its own set of values for the attributes defined in the Car class and can perform actions using the methods defined in the class.
